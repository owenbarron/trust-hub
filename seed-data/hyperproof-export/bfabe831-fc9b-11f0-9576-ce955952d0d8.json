I missed the population that was uploaded for this request.\n\nI have selected three samples from the file provided and have one follow-up item:\n\nA. Follow-up:\nCan you please provide a screenshot showing how the CSV file “account_deletion_requests.csv” was generated? This will allow us to verify which system the report was pulled from and the query/filter used to populate the list.\n\nB. Sample evidence request:\nPlease provide evidence of data deletion completion (e.g., ticket, request record, confirmation, etc.) for the following requests:\n\n1. Jeremy Antone\n2. Eugene Reicher\n3.

      "commentTextFormatted": "A. Generation of \"account_deletion_requests.csv\"\nThe file account_deletion_requests.csv is a manually compiled population list derived from our internal #account-deletion-request Slack channel. When a user submits a deletion request via the production application, an automated bot (Usefull Events) posts the request details—including Name, User ID, and Email—to this monitored channel.\n\nSystem of Record: Slack (Channel: #account-deletion-request) Process: Each request was copied from the Slack message history during the audit window and compiled into the CSV to provide a consolidated view for the audit.\n\nB. Evidence of Deletion Completion\nFor the three requested samples, we have provided two forms of evidence for each:\n\nRequest Record: The original automated notification in Slack confirming the date and time of the request.\n\nDeletion Verification: Screenshots from the Usefull Admin Panel showing that the specific User IDs have been scrubbed of personal identifiable information (PII). In our system, \"Deletion\" results in the email and name fields being overwritten with a DELETED_[ID] string to ensure data privacy while maintaining database integrity.\n\n1. Jeremy Antone (ID: 60328)\nRequest Date: October 25, 2025\n\nStatus: Verified Deleted. The Admin Panel shows the email field as DELETED_60328 and the First/Last Name fields have been cleared.\n\n2. Eugene Reicher (ID: 13064)\nRequest Date: November 5, 2025\n\nStatus: Verified Deleted. The Admin Panel shows the email field as DELETED_13064 and the First/Last Name fields have been cleared.\n\n3. Feletia Lee (ID: 39760)\nRequest Date: December 5, 2025\n\nStatus: Verified Deleted. The Admin Panel shows the email field as DELETED_39760. Note: This user previously held an \"Administrator\" role, which has also been deactivated.",
